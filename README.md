Here I intend to gather some personal projects that involve machine learning concepts and that can be easily transformed into dockerized applications using streamlit.

I intend to briefly describe the concepts involved in each of the applications on [my medium page](https://medium.com/@arthurfmorais) or on [my linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurmorais/). 

You are invited to collaborate!

> **Note:** This is a project for learning purposes only. The concepts applied here are not necessarily proposed for a production environment.

## How to test

```docker compose up```

## Grad CAM

Grad-CAM is an Explainable AI technique that can be used in 
any convolutional neural network regardless of its architecture. 

I wrote a post explaining how this technique works, you can find it on [my medium page](https://medium.com/@arthurfmorais).

The implementation of this application was inspired by a [keras tutorial](https://keras.io/examples/vision/grad_cam/).
